# 3DTetris
This is a 3D rough version of Tetris, providing some essential configuration files for designers (Piece customization, time timer upgrade customization, map range size customization, and Cube unit customization)  
*Game Engine: Unreal 5.1.1*  

## Getting started
Clone this project, enter the subdirectory, the root should look like this:

(PS: If you are cloning this project for the first time, you will be missing some intermediate files. It does not matter. It will be automatically generated after the project is built and .uproject is opened. Your root directory may not contain all the folders in the above picture.)    

1. Right click on the .uproject file and click "Generate Visual Studio project file".  

2. After the .sln is generated, open the .sln file with your IDE (you can use Viisual Studio, I am more used to Rider).  

3. Build the project.

(PS: Make sure your build method is Development Editor. This is how to debug compiles in editor mode, if you choose to DebugGame, it won't work.)  

4. After the Build is complete, double-click to open .uproject.

5. Now you can start working based on this project!.  

## Detailed configuration file parameters

1. Map Size: Set the size of the map (Each unit is based on the size of the Cube Static Mesh).  

2. Cube Static Mesh: The unit cube in the game (You can custom this cube by yourself, but make sure the coordinate origin is at the bottom center of the cube).  

3. Tetris Pieces Config: Each Index represents a new Piece, and each Piece is composed of multiple Cubes, and each Cube needs to fill in specific relative coordinates. (There are two points to note here. The first is that the designer must ensure the input data is valid. First, the Piece itself cannot exceed the boundary of the game. Since the position generated by the Piece is at the top of the game area, it cannot exceed the top. So the z-axis can only be less than or equal to 0, but not greater than 0. The second is to ensure that the relative coordinates of (0,0,0) are included (It's no error if it not included, but it's meanless and not that good). The piece will rotate three axes according to this point, and also make sure (0,0,0) is the center point of the Piece as much as possible so that the rotation will be more natural).  

5. Timer Level: Here you can configure the game's Timer (this Timer determines the interval for each automatic drop of Piece). At the start of the game, the Timer Level with index = 0 will be automatically loaded. If this field is not filled in, the Timer will automatically default to 1. After a certain condition is met, the Timer will be upgraded, and the timer data with index = 1 will be used for the update, and so on; Tick Time represents the time interval of each drop of the Piece; Upgrade Level Type represents the judgment condition of the upgrade. Currently, two conditions are provided. One is the time condition (when the global timer>=condition, the Timer is upgraded), and the second is the score condition (when the player's score >= the condition, upgrade the Timer); Key Value to the New Level is the threshold of the specific condition (If this value is <= 0, means this is the final stage of the Timer Level, will not upgrade anymore).
